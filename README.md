## Partition Manager (pmt)

This binary C is for manage partitions of android devices.
It offers a lot of options. I will place these below. But first let me talk about the operation...

```
1. The partition name is obtained (with the -p or --partition argument)
2. Other arguments (if used) are processed.
3. It is backed up using DD. If the progress is not a problem, it is not given (DD)
```

#### Presented arguments (options)

```
Usage:
   -b | --backup      backup mode
   -F | --flash       flash mode
   -r | --format      format mode (only ext2/3/4 file systems)
   -p | --partition   name of the partition to be backed up
   -l | --logical     know that the partition that will be backed up is logical
   -o | --out         (only backups) the output name of the backed-up partition (default: partition name)
   -d | --outdir      (only backups) directory where the backup partition will be saved (default: /storage/emulated/0)
   -c | --context     it is meant to specify a custom /dev context. Only classic partitions (default: /dev/block/by-name)
   -D | --list        list partitions
   -f | --force       force mode. Output is not produced. Even if it's a mistake. But if the target is not a mode, the error is given. If you want to work stable, it is important to specify this option first.
   -v | --version     see version
        --help        see help message
   -L | --license     see license

Examples:
   -b --partition boot_a -o boot_slot_a_image -d /sdcard/backup -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name
   --flash /sdcard/twrp/boot.img -p boot_a -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name
   -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name --list

#### Some notes

- Feel free to ask any questions you want.
- Packages are available in publications.
- Ä°t is mandatory to use the `-b` | `--backup` or `-f` | `--flash` and `-p` | `--partition` argument. After all, a partition name and progress type is required to be progress.
- If the logical partition flag is not used, a classic partition is tried to be processing by default.

### How is it built?
Even termux is enough to build the pmt. Or you can compile it with linux if you want. NOTE: Use a custom gcc according to the architecture you want to compile.

If you want to change something, take a look at the configuration. You can change him.
it is located in the `config` folder. His name is `env.mk`. I gave the information in the file. You can ask more.

To build;
```
make
```

Special `make` commands (pbt offers :) ;
```
------- Partition Manager help -------

 Commands;
    make                   ==> Build Partition Manager
    make deb               ==> Generate deb (debian) package (compatibility => termux)
    make clean             ==> Clear builded binary.
    make install           ==> If you are using termux, it installs the compiled pmt into termux. So it allows you to use it like a normal command.
    make uninstall         ==> If you are using termux, it uninstalls the compiled pmt into termux. So it allows you to use it like a normal command.
    make help              ==> Display help message
```

I compiled it with termux :D. Why should I bother... I compiled it with `GCC 18.1.4` You can look at the version with the viewing option :)
