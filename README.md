## Partition Manager (pmt)

This binary C is for manage partitions of android devices.
It offers a lot of options. I will place these below. But first let me talk about the operation...

#### Presented arguments (options)

```
Usage:  pmt [OPTIONS] backup PARTITION [OUTPUT] [OPTIONS]...
  or:   pmt [OPTIONS] flash FILE PARTITION [OPTIONS]...
  or:   pmt [OPTIONS] format FILE_SYSTEM[ext/2/3/4] PARTITION [OPTIONS]...

Options:
   -l, --logical     It is meant to determine whether the target partition is logical.
   -c, --context     It is meant to specify a custom /dev context. Only classic partitions (default: /dev/block/by-name).
   -p, --list        List partitions.
   -s, --silent      Information and warning messages are silenced in normal work.
   -f, --force       Force mode. Some things are ignored.
   -S, --set-lang    Set current language.
   -v, --version     See version.
       --help        See this help message.
   -L, --license     See license.

Examples:
   pmt backup boot_a -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name
   pmt flash /sdcard/twrp/boot.img boot_a -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name
   pmt format ext4 system_a --logical
   pmt -c /dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name --list

#### Some notes

- Feel free to ask any questions you want.
- Packages are available in publications.
- If the logical partition flag is not used, a classic partition is tried to be processing by default.
- [Click to see special version changes](https://github.com/YZBruh/pbt/blob/2.3.0/CHANGELOG.md)
- Let me know your suggestions!

### How is it built?
Android NDK is required to build.
 - [Download](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) and extract the NDK package.
 - Clone this repository. And get access to it.
```
git clone https://github.com/YZBruh/pbt -b 2.3.0 ./pmt
cd pmt
```
 - Set the NDK working directory variable.
```
export NDK_PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd)
```
 - Go to the NDK directory and start the construction
```
./ndk-build
```
 - The output files will be inside the `pmt` folder. Binaries are available in two architectures within the `libs` folder. `arm64-v8a` (64-bit) and `armeabi-v7a` (32-bit).
```

                           __________|__________
                           |                   |
                       arm64-v8a/         armeabi-v7a/
                           |                   |
                          pmt                 pmt
```
 - For the make installable debian package make-deb.sh use the script. It can be created within two architectures. Use the script flags correctly: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a. If you want to process with root, add sudo as the second argument. If you don't want, use no-sudo or leave it blank

```
--Usage--

./make-deb.sh [arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a] [sudo, no-sudo, <blank>]
```
 
```
chmod 777 utils.sh

# for making 64-bit package
./utils.sh make-deb arm64-v8a 

# for making 32-bit package
./utils.sh make-deb armeabi-v7a
```

### Notes
If you want to change something, take a look at the configuration. You can change him.
it is located in the `jni/config` folder. His name is `env.mk`. I gave the information in the file. You can ask more.
